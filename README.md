# Station Terraform Module

The Station Terraform module can be used to provision workload environments in Azure. Station takes care of creating a set of must-have resources for a successful workload deployment. With automatic Terraform Cloud integration and OIDC configuration, Station makes deploying easy and fast. Start writing your workload code right away.

To learn the basics of Station, check out our [tutorial](./docs/tutorial.md) (COMING!).

Think of Station as a train station, and Azure as your destination. To get to Azure your IaC deployments must start with Station.

Station is maintained by the DevOps team at blinQ (https://blinq.no).
