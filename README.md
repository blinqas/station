## Prerequisites

Before using this module, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) installed on your local machine.
- An [Azure account](https://azure.com) and valid credentials for resource provisioning.

## Usage

### Module Configuration

To use the "Station" module, you need to include it in your Terraform configuration. Here's an example snippet of how you can configure the module:

```hcl
module "station" {
  source = "path/to/module"

  # Customize module settings here
}
```

#### Configuration Parameters

- `environment_name`: The name of the environment (e.g., "dev").
- `role_definition_name_on_workload_rg`: The role definition name for the workload resource group.
- `user_assigned_identities`: Define user-assigned identities and their associated role assignments.
- `resource_groups`: Configure resource groups and their locations.
- `federated_identity_credential_config`: Configuration for federated identity credentials.
- `tags`: Tags to be applied to resources.
- `groups`: Configure security groups and their settings.
- `applications`: Configure applications, their settings, and permissions.
- `data "azurerm_client_config" "current"`: Azure client configuration data.

### Output Values

- `client_id`: The Client ID of the workload Azure AD service principal.
- `workload_service_principal_object_id`: The Object ID of the workload Azure AD service principal.
- `tenant_id`: The Azure AD Tenant ID.
- `subscription_id`: The Azure Subscription ID.
- `workload_resource_group_name`: The name of the resource group where workload resources are located.
- `applications`: A map of configured applications, their settings, and permissions.
- `groups`: A map of configured security groups and their settings.
- `user_assigned_identities`: A map of configured user-assigned identities and their associated role assignments.

These output values are useful for integrating your deployment process with other services, scripts, or configurations. You can use these values to ensure that resources are accessed and managed correctly.

Remember that the actual values of these outputs will depend on your specific deployment and configuration choices. Always refer to the outputs of your actual Terraform deployment for accurate information.
